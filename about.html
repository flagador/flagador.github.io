                        I was born on the 27th of November 2000. In 2018, I got my "Baccalauréat S" option "Sciences de l'ingénieur". I have always been passionnate about tech and electronics in general. I spend my free time building or repairing computers, tablets and phones. I also fly First Person View racing quadcopters. I own 3 3D printers, I have learned to model 3D files and to 3D scan. The thing I love doing the most is inventing, building and programming automated robots with arduinos. I built my own drones, electric skateboard, bike blinkers, bluetooth speaker, led cube and much more... My dream is to be able to live of what I love, becoming an entrepreneur would be a solution. My goal is to contribute to the technological advance and sharing it.

                        For example, in 2015, I won the "Innovez" contest from the magazine "Sciences et vie junior" with my invention the "Régulateur de volume TV" which regulates the sound emitted from your TV at a chosen noise level because as you may know, it isn't the same between channels or programms.

                        I am currently studying computer science at the IUT of Lannion. I can programm in C and Java, i know HTML/CSS and wordpress. I also use SQL and UML. I learned how to think as a computer scientist and to participate in projects. For my first semester project, we had to make a website from the ground up in groups of 4 students, I really liked it. For the second semester project we have to make a Java programm in groups of 4 or 5, with my group we are gonna make a UML Diagramm creator which translates classes in Java in real time. I'm fond of working with other people to get to the same goal.
